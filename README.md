# Yousign Salesforce Integration Toolbox

You have discovered Yousign API and want to integrate it fast and without issues in Salesforce ? We have good news, you are in the right place !

## Introduction

This repository contains code examples to integrate the Yousign API into Salesforce. We will connect through named credentials with an API Key.
The code samples, the initialization package and the documentation provided here complete but does not substitute the [Yousign API documentation](https://developers.yousign.com/docs/introduction-new) where you will find a [dedicated Salesforce section](https://developers.yousign.com/docs/integration-salesforce-yousign) :rocket:

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Having an Yousign account with API.If you do not have an API key yet, please create a free [Yousign trial account](https://yousign.app/welcome?lang=en&product=api&signup_source=api_doc) !
2. A Salesforce Developer, Enterprise (or above) Edition. If you do not have a Enterprise (or above) Edition you will need some extra development.
3. Visual Studio Code. Your Visual Studio Code should be set up with the necessary [Salesforce development tools](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/set-up-your-lightning-web-components-developer-tools/install-development-tools) including the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli).

### Installation steps

1. Authorize your Salesforce Developer Account within Visual Studio Code. To do this press `command + shift + P` (on a Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (on Windows) to open the Command Palette. Then type `SFDX:Authorize an Org` and press `Enter`. In the browser window that opens, log into your Salesforce Organization, then on the next screen, click `Allow to grant access`.
2. Download or clone the SFDC-Toolbox repository.
3. Deploy the code to Salesforce. To do this, navigate to the `force-app/main/default/manifest/` folder in the menu on the left and right-click default, then select SFDX: Deploy Source to Org. Now when you sign into your Salesforce Developer Edition (account) you will find the clases and Lightning Web Components defined in this project.
